# The Possible Game - Final Project

## User Story

Have you ever found yourself bored out of your mind? Have some time to kill? Want to play a game that already exists only it's built in a native JavaScript environment using react? 

One of the most super addictive and exciting games you have ever experienced, based on the best-selling Xbox Live Indie Game, which was based on a very hard game-platform – The Possible Game. 

## Business Context

Gameplay is really simple and straightforward, it just consists of an automatically fast moving square through a level and while you make your square jump over smashing objects, the game becomes more and more exciting and interesting. The Possible Game is known as the “Insanely Addictive” side scrolling game. Each time you start the game you will experience something new, but if you are a person who is capable of beating the first level, you will get better. The Possible Game came out quite a while ago on the Xbox 360, now you are able to enjoy it on the iPhone as well and play it here on our site. Have fun and enjoy The Possible Game!
